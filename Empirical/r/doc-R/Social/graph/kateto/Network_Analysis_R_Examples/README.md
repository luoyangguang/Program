Network Analysis: R Examples & Labs
===========================

R scripts and handouts from COMM 645: Communication Networks, a USC class led by Peter Monge that I TA-ed for in 2012.
Note that the scripts should still work, but some of the packages used in them (RSiena, ergm, etc.) have evolved in the past couple of years and have a broader functionality that is not reflected in the examples here.
