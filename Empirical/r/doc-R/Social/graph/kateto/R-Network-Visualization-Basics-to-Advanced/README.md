# R-Network-Visualization-Basics-to-Advanced

<strong>Basic and advanced network visualization with R <br></strong>
(code and tutorial from my Sunbelt 2016 workshop)<br>

The tutorial covers network visualization using the R language for statistical computing (<a href="http://cran.r-project.org">cran.r-project.org</a>) and RStudio (<a href="rstudio.com">rstudio.com</a>). It provides a brief overview of network formats, focusing on their structure and representation in key R packages. The manual includes a step-by-step guide describing (through series of examples) the path from raw data to graph visualization in the igraph and Statnet frameworks. The advanced portion of this manual introduces dynamic visualization for longitudinal networks and combining networks with geographic maps.
